# DevOps + SRE Daily Challenge - Terraform Deep Dive ðŸŽ‰

## Welcome Back, Learners!

In our **Terraform** journey, todayâ€™s challenge takes a deep dive into **Terraform blocks**, **provider configurations**, and the use of **variables** to create reusable, scalable infrastructure code. Weâ€™ll also explore the concepts of **outputs** and **locals**, which help in managing complex configurations effectively.

> **Keep Reading Till the End for the Surprise!** ðŸŽ‰  
> As today's challenge covers several core concepts of Terraform, we will be sending multiple parts throughout the day for better clarity. Below is the brief outline of what to expect:
